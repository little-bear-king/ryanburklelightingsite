    <h1>Ryan Burkle Lighting</h1>
    <P>Welcome! My name is Ryan Burkle. I am currently based in Chicago, IL and work as a Freelance Lighting Designer, and Programmer. My wide knowledge of the Design, Artistic, and Technical aspects of Lighting allow me to create well rounded and meaningful Works.
        It is my goal as a designer to use the primal, and affecting power of Light to tell stories that invigorate and excite audiences, while challenging people to question their perceptions of the world around them.
        I have nearly 10 years of experience lighting all kinds of performance; including theatre, dance, circus, weddings, and corporate shows. I am confident I can help you craft the stories you are pursuing with skill, care, and an artistic sensibility.
        Please see "Available Services" to see a more detailed list of Services that I provide. </P>
