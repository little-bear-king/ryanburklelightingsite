    <P>Welcome! My name is Ryan Burkle. I am currently based in Chicago, IL and work as a Freelance Lighting Designer, and Programmer. My wide knowledge of the Design, Artistic, and Technical aspects of Lighting allow me to create well rounded and meaningful Works.</P>
        <P>It is my goal as a designer to use the primal, and affecting power of Light to tell stories that invigorate and excite audiences, while challenging people to question their perceptions of the world around them.
        I have nearly 10 years of experience lighting all kinds of performance; including theatre, dance, circus, weddings, and corporate shows. I am confident I can help you craft the stories you are pursuing with skill, care, and an artistic sensibility.</P>
        <P>Please see <a href="availableServices.html">Available Services</a> to see a more detailed list of Services that I provide. </P>
