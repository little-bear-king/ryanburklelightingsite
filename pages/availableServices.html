    <h3>Lighting Design</h3>
    <P>The process of crafting a new design brings me new problems to solve and new stories to tell. With a Design Contract you will get a fully realized Lighting Design that supports the other aspects of your work, while maintaining a strong voice in and of itself.</P> <P>Along with the physical manifestation of the design, you will also receive copies of all the paperwork, and details that go into creating it, for your records.</P>

    <P>As an Assistant Lighting Designer I bring many skills to the table, including <I>Drafting, Communication Skills, Paperwork Management Skills, Crew Leadership Experience, and a Designers sensibility</I>. Having worked as an Assistant in places ranging from Small/Medium Ballet Companies, to LORT Theaters, I can help set you up for success in realizing your ideas of a Lighting Design.</P>
    
    <h3>Theatrical Lighting and Scenic Drafting</h3>
    <P>I have been drafting using Vectorworks for as long as I have been practicing Lighting Design.
